<h3>Description</h3>
After passing the first part of the Unistart, I get to move on the to the last 6 weeks of the program. Because the learning to learn program has taught me about all the basic skill that I need like paraphrase or how to avoid plagiarism, I feel like I have the fundamental on the best way to do good in the last part of unistart. <space>
	
	<h3>Feeling</h3>
The course introduction to science was kind of throw me off since I thought this have to do with physic or math but so far until now, it just has been a preview and add a bit information on the last class such as how to access to library or synthesize. I was late first day at school, but the professor was really nice about it, so it made me very comfortable. Because of RMIT is known for its business courses, so the science and technology has way less students, but I prefer it that way because I can see that we really working well as a small group together and everyone is close. I made friends with everyone in the class, and this will make the group assignment much easier because we already have the chemistry in order to help each other. Even though RMIT allows student go back to campus, but we still have hybrid class. Personally, I really like it because I could have a more flexible time since I often traveled back and forth to my hometown which is 2 hours away from campus.<space>

	<h3>Evaluation/Analyses</h3>
Even if the class is online or face to face, the professor always delivered. Mr. Jonathan really passionate in teaching and it shows, he is always answered every question that the student asked or assist the guess lecturer with examples even though that person did not ask for like when Mrs. Trang show us how to use IEEE format.<space>

	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
Overall, I was happy with the first 2 week of this course, because it helps me preview on the past lessons and provide me with new information about the course.<space>
