title: Action Plan
---
Upon finishing the Unistart program, I feel like I can continue my journey in education easier because I have gained a lot of lessons during the 3 months of this program. To pursue my education as best as I can, I have come up with a plan for my future. First, I will review all the lesson that I have been taught in the Unistart program like how to avoid plagiarism or how to synthesize, as well as seeking help from the lecturer even though I have passed the course. Not just that, I can also go to the library to ask for help or finding out information that I need in order to ace my assignment. As I mentioned in one of the reflections, in order to have do good in class, I have to be focus and luckily I have found a method that can help me with that. I will still maintain my sleep schedule as well as working out at least 4 days a week so that my body and my mind can keep up with my each other. I also plan to develop a meditation habit to strengthen my mind even more. I also have an epiphany about how doing it all by yourself is actually a weakness, I used to think that I can take a heavy workload alone but all the group assignment in the past few months would have take a beat on me if I didn’t cooperate, so in order to fix that, I took an advice from Mr. Jonathan to join a group that related to my field and make friends there so that I can have a better support from not just research but from peers also because they also have experience. This is my plan for my university life, and I will try my best to follow this because I know it is beneficial for my education.
