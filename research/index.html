	<h3>Description</h3>
	
	After the break, we were heading toward last 3 weeks of the course, and this is when I have to do the assignments. After the break, we get to go back to the campus like usual. Even though, the program is aim to introduce student to the science technology filed but the assignment were pretty vague and doesn’t mention about my major which is EE, but I still enjoy doing it because I want to know everything a little, and this reflection will show why.
	
	<h3>Feeling</h3>
	
	This week after the break, I have gained so much consciousness and will power to force myself to be a better person. I didn’t have any trouble falling as sleep and felt good waking up and because of that, I could be more focus more than ever in class and luckily, this was when Mr. Jonathan started talking about the group assignment about technology. The lecturer gathered ideas from every student and made we wrote it on the board and there were some pretty interests idea but like quantum mathematic or nanobots but the one that peaked my interest was metaverse because it is now the next big thing in the tech world and I want to know it better. I quickly found my peers with the same interest in the  so we could do it together. 
	
	<h3>Evaluation/Analyses</h3>
	I was pretty happy to have Man and Khang to be in the group when we do this project because we have talked before, and they are very friendly and cooperative. Man helped me a lot with the class activities. The lecturer was very helpful in class because of his passionate way of teaching. Mr. Jonathan provides us all the information we can get in the class and keep the students engaged in the lessons. I really like it when he let students pick groups instead of randomizing the class into random group since there were people that I have never talked to in class so that would be awkward.

	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	
	Having the break is truly blessed to me because I have trained myself to focus more on the lecture and I can get the best information I can get to do my assignment well, this including all the helpful links that was being provided by the lecturer last week to help with the next task.
