<h3>Description</h3>
The third week of the course is happened during the holiday week which was Christmas, therefore, I have a one week break from school.
	<h3>Feeling</h3>
I really needed this because lately I can’t not concentrate in school since my sleep scheduled was not in order and I need time to fix this and Christmas came in handy. Before the actual break, we don’t have any school after last Thursday so all the student in the class asked each other out for lunch and we have such a good time. We discussed about the deadlines and the task that we have to do in the class like how to use github and upload the weekly reflection onto the site, not just that, we actually know each other better.
	<h3>Evaluation/Analyses</h3>
This could be very beneficial for the future group assignment because we have chemistry amongst the group so helping out each other will be easier. I went back to my hometown the next day which was 2 hours away from the school to get my mind right and fix my sleep schedule.
	<h3>Action Plan and conclusion</h3>
To do that, I have set up a plan for each day include running every afternoon to keep drained my energy in the night, not using any electronic device that can create a blue light an hour before bed time, I also developed a routine for meditating in the morning so I can practice to keep my mind clear in order to sleep well at night. It was hard to follow so I picked up some self-help book to find a way to keep myself motivated. I think that by doing all this, I can have a different mindset and use this to concentrate in class.
